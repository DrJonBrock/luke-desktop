# Luke Desktop Project Prompt

Please use the following prompt for any chat sessions related to the Luke Desktop project:

---

I am working on Luke Desktop, a Tauri + React + TypeScript application located at C:\Users\lukef\AppData\Roaming\Claude\LukeDesktop. This is a Claude Desktop alternative with MCP server support. The project uses Tauri for the desktop framework, React with TypeScript for the frontend, and follows the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for server integration.

Before proceeding, please:
1. Review the current CHECKLIST.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, and README.md in the project directory
2. Familiarize yourself with the MCP specification at https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
3. Note that we are using:
   - Node.js v22.11.0+
   - Rust v1.83.0+
   - Cargo v1.83.0+

You have access to the project filesystem through the available functions. Please always:
- Update documentation files when making changes
- Think step by step
- Ask for confirmation before major changes
- Help maintain project organization and clean code
- Update the checklist as tasks are completed

How would you like to proceed with development today?
